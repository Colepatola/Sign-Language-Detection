# Sign-Language-Detection
Overview
This project aims to develop an artificial intelligence model capable of detecting and interpreting sign language gestures in real-time using Python and TensorFlow. By leveraging the TensorFlow object detection API and the pre-trained SSD MobileNet model, the project provides a robust and efficient solution for sign language recognition, facilitating improved communication for the deaf and hard-of-hearing community.

Features
Real-time Detection: Utilizes a webcam to capture and detect sign language gestures in real-time.
Pre-trained Model: Implements SSD MobileNet for efficient and accurate object detection.
Transfer Learning: Enhances model performance by fine-tuning a pre-trained model on a custom dataset of sign language gestures.
User-Friendly Interface: Provides an easy-to-use interface for users to interact with the detection system.
High Accuracy: Achieves high accuracy through extensive testing and validation across various environments and lighting conditions.
