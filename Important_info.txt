STEPS for running OBJECT DECECTION (2024)

Step 1)
Clone the repo from tensor flow, specifically the models folder

Step 2)
run python 3.8.19 in anaconda

Step 3)
cd to the research folder and before running the python command to train the AI, in the research folder, make sure to run "pip install -r requirements.txt" in the research folder because this will ensure we are using PyYaML 5.3.1

Step 4) cd to the research folder and run these commands sequentially: 
protoc object_detection/protos/*.proto --python_out=.
cp object_detection/packages/tf2/setup.py .
python -m pip install .

Step 5)
Open vs code, Go to augment.py and replace

from tensorflow.python.keras.layers.preprocessing import image_preprocessing as image_ops

With the import below

from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing import image as image_ops
